## Installation
### For Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Waterfox (Desktop)
#### Automatic import
- Install [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).

- Press "_Subscribe_" to import the filter list.

#### Manual import
If the automatic import didn't work, (possibly due to multiple adblockers being installed), try the following:
- Install [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).
- Click the uBlock button in the toolbar and open Dashboard Settings (gear icon)
- Select the "_Filter lists_" tab
- Open the "_Import..._" section and paste [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/GenAI-Blocklist.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/GenAI-Blocklist.txt)

### For Opera

Unfortunately, this filter list does not currently work in Opera.

Importing the filters had no effect when testing with both uBlock Origin and Opera's built in ad blocking. ([May be an issue with Opera](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/issues/64))

## Optional extra blocklist
There is an additional optional filterlist [`GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt) with additional blocks. These are more subjective blocks and may be more prone to accidentally blocking some non-AI content. These include:
* DeviantArt: Images from accounts that have posted AI images
* Reddit: Posts from AI-focused subreddits 
* X: Any post from Grok account
* AI category section on news sites (Just the category, not posts covering AI)

These filters were previously part of the main blocklist, but it was split off as a separate list you can toggle on and off.

## FAQ
#### Q: Does this prevent AI content from being generated?
No. AI elements are only hidden. In most cases, AI content will still be generated in the background.

#### Q: Will this work with Adblock Plus?
No. The list can be added to Adblock Plus, but it does not work for some unknown reason.

#### Q: Will this work with [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html)?
Yes. If you are using Google Chrome, you will need to enable "Allow User Scripts" in the settings.

#### Q: Will this work with Pi-hole?
No. Pi-hole and uBlock Origin work differently. uBlock Origin allows filtering individual elements on pages, while Pi-hole blocks entire domains.

#### Q: Will this remove search results from sites that post AI generated content?
No. If you want to block sites from search engines, try [laylavish's Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist).
