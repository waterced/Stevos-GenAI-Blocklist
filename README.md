A filter list for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock?tab=readme-ov-file#ublock-origin-ubo) and [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html) that hides specific website features that use or promote Generative AI.

## Optional extra blocklist
There is an additional optional filter list [`GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt) with additional blocks. These are more subjective blocks and may be more prone to accidentally blocking some non-AI content or content that may be required for site functionality. These include:
* DeviantArt: Images from accounts that have posted AI images.
* Reddit: Posts from AI-focused subreddits.
* X: Posts made by @Grok.
* AI category section on news sites (Just the category, not posts covering AI).
* Customer support chatbots that must be used before you can contact human customer support.

## FAQ
### Can I use these filters with [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/en/) or [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)?
No. The list can be added, but it does not work for some unknown reason.

### Can I use these filters with [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html)?
Yes. If you are using Google Chrome, you will need to enable "Allow User Scripts" in the settings.

### Can I use these filters with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)?
No. Pi-hole and uBlock Origin work differently. uBlock Origin allows filtering individual elements on pages, while Pi-hole blocks entire domains.

### Can I use these filters with [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)?
No. The filter list can be imported, but it had no effect when tested with both the uBlock Origin extension for Opera and Opera's built in ad blocker. ([This may be an issue with Opera](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/issues/64))

### Will this remove search results from sites that post AI generated content?
No. If you want to block sites from search engines, try [laylavish's Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist).

### Why is AdGuard recommended for Google Chrome and iOS instead of uBlock Origin or uBlock Origin Lite?
uBlock Origin is not available for Google Chrome and iOS. While uBlock Origin Lite exists as an alternative, it [does not support custom filter lists](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/167#issuecomment-2271471121). A previous version of this README suggested copying the GenAI filters into uBO Lite's custom filters as a workaround. However, filtering was unreliable, updating required [manually deleting the old filter rules](https://superuser.com/q/1934748/358766), and some filter rules were incompatible.

Due to these limitations, AdGuard is recommended over uBlock Origin Lite.

### Does this prevent AI content from being generated in the background?
Sometimes, but usually not.

These filters hide AI elements. In some cases this may stop the generation. For example, if you load [this Google Search page](https://www.google.com/search?q=SQL+What+percentage+of+users+have+accessed+a+group) with filters on, then toggle "cosmetic filtering" off in uBlock Origin, you can see the AI overview won't generate until after it gets unhidden. However, AI content may still be generated in the background on other webpages.

### How many websites have filters for AI features?
Over 200.
