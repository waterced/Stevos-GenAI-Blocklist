# Stevo's GenAI Blocklist

A filter list for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock?tab=readme-ov-file#ublock-origin-ubo) and [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html) that hides specific website features that use or promote Generative AI.

* Press *Add*.

### Opera

Unfortunately, this filter list does not currently work in Opera.

Importing the filters had no effect when testing with both uBlock Origin and Opera's built in ad blocking. ([May be an issue with Opera](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/issues/64))

## Optional extra blocklist
There is an additional optional filterlist [`GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stevoisiak/Stevos-GenAI-Blocklist/refs/heads/main/GenAI-Blocklist-Extra.txt) with additional blocks. These are more subjective blocks and may be more prone to accidentally blocking some non-AI content or content that may be required for site functionality. These include:
* DeviantArt: Images from accounts that have posted AI images.
* Reddit: Posts from AI-focused subreddits.
* X: Posts made by @Grok.
* AI category section on news sites (Just the category, not posts covering AI).
* Customer support chatbots that are must be used before you can contact human customer support.

## FAQ
### Why are the filters not working on iOS?
The custom filter functionality in uBlock Origin Lite can be a bit inconsistent. ([Apparently it wasn't designed for large filter lists](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/issues/167#issuecomment-4106088427)). Temporarily switching filter mode in uBlock Origin Lite may help, but results may vary.

### Will this work with [Adblock](https://getadblock.com/en/) or [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/)?
No. The list can be added, but it does not work for some unknown reason.

### Will this work with [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html)?
Yes. If you are using Google Chrome, you will need to enable "Allow User Scripts" in the settings.

### Will this work with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)?
No. Pi-hole and uBlock Origin work differently. uBlock Origin allows filtering individual elements on pages, while Pi-hole blocks entire domains.

### Will this remove search results from sites that post AI generated content?
No. If you want to block sites from search engines, try [laylavish's Huge AI Blocklist](https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist).

### Does this prevent AI content from being generated in the background?
Sometimes, but not always.

These filters work by hiding the AI elements. In some cases this may stop the generation. For example, if you load [this Google Search page](https://www.google.com/search?q=SQL+What+percentage+of+users+have+accessed+a+group) with filters on, then toggle "cosmetic filtering" off in uBlock Origin, you can see the AI overview won't generate until after it gets unhidden. However, AI content may still be generated in the background on other webpages.
